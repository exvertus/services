Howdy folks :)
This is just a basic index.html for now, but stay tuned for more to come.
There is plenty to add to here, so if you'd like to get involved please talk to me.
Here is a taste of what I see us adding next:
<ul>
    <li>Put this page behind IAP so only we can access it</li>
    <li>Setting up Jenkins and adding a link here for it</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a vanilla Jenkins instance from helm template command</li>
        <li>Kustomize with overlay</li>
        <li>Add job for Darnbot (can be sliced further)</li>
        <li>Add self-building job</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Move any secret values we have to GCP's Secret Manager</li>
    <li>Explore local k8s options for us to use (Minikube, Kind, k3s)</li>
    <li>Set up a mail server on our GKE cluster</li>
</ul>
</pre>
